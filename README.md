# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (Google × Kaggle)

This repository contains materials, notes, and exercises for the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google**, hosted on Kaggle.  
The course explores the core components and engineering practices behind building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents — moving beyond LLM prototypes to production-ready systems.

---

## Overview

**Duration:** 10–14 November 2025  
**Hosted by:** Google  
**Platform:** Kaggle  
**Format:** Five days of lectures, whitepapers, podcasts, and codelabs, followed by a capstone project.  

The intensive focuses on:
- Core principles of agentic architecture  
- Tool interoperability via Model Context Protocol (MCP)  
- Context engineering and memory systems  
- Evaluation, observability, and quality control  
- Deployment, scaling, and multi-agent collaboration  

Participants completing the **capstone project** earn a Kaggle badge recognising successful completion of the intensive.

## Capstone Project

The capstone marks the culmination of the intensive.  
Participants design and implement an AI agent using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, demonstrating at least three capabilities learned during the week (e.g., memory, orchestration, evaluation).

**Submission Requirements:**
- Kaggle notebook or GitHub repository link  
- Short video overview of the agent  
- Write-up describing motivation, architecture, and evaluation  

**Timeline:**
- Launch: *14 November 2025*  
- Submission Deadline: *30 November 2025, 11:59 PM PT*
